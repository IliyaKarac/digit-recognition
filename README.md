-To use image process.py you must have a python version of 3.4.0 or higher in your windows path, the version used for this code is 3.7.6

-You must also have Pip installed version does not matter

-next you will want to have image process.py in the same folder as the images you wish to test

-open command prompt and change directory to the directory you placed image process.py

-in command prompt type in   install opencv-python

-now you can open the .py code using any IDE the one we used is wingware ide but anaconda probably also has a good one aswell

-on line 9 change the name of the file to the image you wish to test (it has to be in the same folder as image process.py)

-run the code

!DISCLAIMER: the image has to be 100x100 pixels otherwise it will not work
